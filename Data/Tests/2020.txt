What is an IDE in the context of programming?;A tool that manages source code history.;A complex form of a compiler.;An integrated development environment that combines several tools to assist in software development.;A type of software that handles database management.;2
What is a Lambda expression in Java?;A function that is written to delay the execution of a piece of code.;A concise way to represent an anonymous function that can be passed around as data.;A type of exception in Java.;A verbose approach for writing instance methods.;1
What is the difference between overloading and overriding a method in Java?;Overloading occurs within the same class, and overriding happens between parent and child classes.;Overloading is changing the way a method works, and overriding is creating a method with the same name.;Overloading allows multiple methods in one class, and overriding is used to change method permissions.;Overriding is used to change the return type of a method, and overloading to change its parameters.;0
How can you manage memory in Java?;Memory management is done automatically via the Garbage Collector.;Memory can be manually allocated and deallocated using pointers.;Memory allocation is controlled by the programmer explicitly.;Memory is managed through reference counting.;0
What role does the 'volatile' keyword play in Java?;It ensures that a variable is always read from the main memory and not from the thread's private cache.;It makes a variable immutable.;It restricts a variable's scope to a single thread.;It enhances the performance by allowing temporary caching of variables.;0
What is the main difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?;Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.;Checked exceptions are for recoverable conditions and unchecked are for programming errors.;Unchecked exceptions derive from Error or RuntimeException.;All of the above.;3
In Java, what is the purpose of the 'synchronized' keyword?;To ensure that a method or block is accessed by only one thread at a time.;To prevent the thread from executing a specific part of code.;To enhance the performance of multithreaded programs.;To synchronize all threads running in an application.;0
How do you ensure data encapsulation in Java?;By using private visibility modifiers and getters/setters.;By declaring all classes abstract.;By using static methods exclusively.;By avoiding the use of inheritance.;0
What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList in Java?;ArrayList is based on an array and LinkedList is based on a doubly linked list.;ArrayList allows faster random read access, while LinkedList allows faster insertions and deletions.;LinkedList uses more memory than ArrayList for storing elements.;All of the above.;3
How does Java achieve platform independence?;Through the use of JVMs (Java Virtual Machines) that allow Java programs to run on different devices.;By compiling code into platform-specific machine code.;By translating Java bytecode into native code at runtime.;By restricting Java to certain platforms only.;0
What is the significance of the 'this' keyword in Java?;It refers to the current instance of the class in which it is used.;It is used to call static methods within the class.;It refers to the superclass of the current class.;It is used to declare constant values in a class.;0
What are generics in Java?;A way to use type parameters in class, interface, and method definitions.;A technique for defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.;A mechanism for defining high-performance algorithms in Java.;A method for ensuring type safety in collections and other data structures.;0
How do interfaces differ from abstract classes in Java?;Interfaces cannot have any method implementations (prior to Java 8), while abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.;Interfaces require multiple inheritance, whereas abstract classes do not.;Abstract classes are used to represent critical entities, interfaces are not.;Interfaces are more flexible and can have default methods (since Java 8).;0
What is type casting in Java?;Converting one data type into another, either implicitly or explicitly.;The process of changing an object of one class type into another class type.;Assigning a value of one type to a variable of another type.;A method for changing the type of an object at runtime.;0
What is the purpose of the 'throw' keyword in Java?;It is used to explicitly throw an exception.;It indicates that a method can throw an exception.;It is used to handle an exception that has been thrown.;It is used to prevent further propagation of an exception.;0
